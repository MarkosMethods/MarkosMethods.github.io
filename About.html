      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p class="lead2">
        I’m currently completing a Master of Computer Science at Concordia University, after
        accelerating my Bachelor’s degree finishing in 2 years. My academic focus is machine learning and systems,
        but I care just as much about fundamentals: algorithms, numerical thinking, and efficiency.
      
<br><br>
      
        I’ve lived across many countries, Serbia, Abu Dhabi, Canada, and Australia, and even more cities within these countries.
        Moving that much forces you to get comfortable with uncertainty early. I learned how to adapt, how to observe before acting, and how to rebuild momentum when context changes.

      <h2>What I’m focused on</h2>
      <p>
       My work centers on building learning systems that remain reliable under uncertainty. In my research, this means moving beyond fixed, hand-engineered assumptions and designing pipelines that can recognize when their own representations are insufficient, adapt their feature space, and remain interpretable as they evolve.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-items">
        <li>Learning pipelines that explicitly account for uncertainty, preference ambiguity, and model underdetermination</li>
        <li>Modular feature representations that can expand when observed behavior cannot be explained by existing assumptions</li>
        <li>Evaluation frameworks that prioritize alignment, sufficiency, and failure analysis over headline performance</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article class="card half">
  <h2>Financial engineering interests</h2>
  <p>
    My interests lie in financial engineering problems that require both mathematical rigor and practical
    implementation. I’m particularly interested in applying machine learning to time series and decision problems
    in ways that expose structure, uncertainty, and limitations rather than obscuring them.
  </p>
  <ul class="list-items">
    <li>Time series analysis, feature design, and validation discipline</li>
    <li>Risk, costs, and robustness as first-class modeling constraints</li>
    <li>Using ML creatively for simulation, diagnostics, and strategy research</li>
  </ul>
</article>


    <article class="card third">
      <h2>How I work</h2>
      <p>
        I care about momentum and clarity. I’d rather ship something small and correct than something huge and fragile.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-items">
        <li>Baselines before complexity</li>
        <li>Measure first, optimize second</li>
        <li>Make progress visible</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article class="card third">
      <h2>What I value</h2>
      <p>
        Reliability beats flash. The goal is to build things that hold up when conditions change.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-items">
        <li>Correctness and maintainability</li>
        <li>Honest testing and iteration</li>
        <li>Good communication and clean handoffs</li>
      </ul>
    </article>

    <article class="card third">
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>
        I’ve lived and studied across multiple places, which forced adaptability early and made “learning fast” a habit.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-items">
        <li>Comfortable in new environments</li>
        <li>Self-driven learning outside coursework</li>
        <li>High tolerance for difficult problems</li>
